      <title>Weekly driver 4: ENC28J60, Ethernet for your microcontroller</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s week number 11 and the weekly driver #4 is out! Last time, I did drivers 1 and 2 so you may be wondering where&amp;rsquo;s driver 3? Driver #3, the MCP3008, was covered by @pcein in their blog. Also, as of now there are at least 14 (!) drivers being worked on by the community.
This week I&amp;rsquo;m releasing a driver for the ENC28J60, an Ethernet controller with SPI interface.</description>

      <description>Oh, time flies. It&amp;rsquo;s already week 8 and we have zero weekly driver posts out there &amp;ndash; don&amp;rsquo;t worry though because there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of drivers and embedded-hal implementations in the works.
To play catch up in this post I&amp;rsquo;ll cover two embedded-hal drivers: the l3gd20 and the lsm303dlhc. The L3GD20 is an IC that contains a gyroscope and exposes I2C and SPI interfaces; the LSM303DLHC is an IC that contains an accelerometer and a magnetometer, and exposes an I2C interface.</description>

      <title>Zero cost stack overflow protection for ARM Cortex-M devices</title>

      <description>One of the core features of Rust is memory safety. Whenever possible the compiler enforces memory safety at compile. One example of this is the borrow checker which prevents data races, iterator invalidation, pointer invalidation and other issues at compile time. Other memory problems like buffer overflows can&amp;rsquo;t be prevented at compile time. In those cases the compiler inserts runtime checks, bounds checks in this case, to enforce memory safety at runtime.</description>

      <title>Memory safe DMA transfers</title>

      <description>UPDATE Given the comments I&amp;rsquo;ve received so far I think I should more explicitly mention that the context here are systems that lack a MMU and where a memory allocator may or may not be available or desirable, e.g. Cortex-M microcontrollers.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe an approach to building memory safe DMA based APIs.
DMA? DMA stands for Direct Memory Access and it&amp;rsquo;s a peripheral used for transferring data between two memory locations in parallel to the operation of the core processor.</description>

      <title>RTFM v0.3.0: safe `&amp;&#39;static mut T` and less locks</title>

      <description>RTFM (Real Time For the Masses) v0.3.0 is out! This blog post will cover the goodies of this new release.
The minor (breaking) release was mainly to become compatible with the new IO model presented in my previous blog post, but a new feature also shipped with this release: safe creation of &amp;amp;&#39;static mut references.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at one feature that landed in v0.2.1 but that didn&amp;rsquo;t get documented in this blog, yet it was essential to adapt RTFM to the new IO model:</description>

      <description>This is my #Rust2018 blog post.
These are some things I think the Rust team needs to address this year to make Rust a (more) viable alternative to C/C++ in the area of bare metal (i.e. no_std) embedded applications.
Stability Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of breakage / regressions I encountered (i.e. that I had to work around / fix) during 2017:
 Changes in target specification files broke compilation of no_std projects that use custom targets.</description>

      <description>Hey there! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some cool stuff for you. Now that&amp;rsquo;s in more or less good shape I can blog about it!
This blog post introduces our new approach to I/O in embedded contexts.
Overview: The register model First some background information
In microcontrollers all external I/O requires interacting with peripherals. Peripherals are additional pieces of electronics that sit in the same chip / package as the core processor.</description>

      <title>RTFM v2: simpler, less overhead and more device support</title>
      <link>http://blog.japaric.io/rtfm-v2/</link>

      <description>Hiya folks! It&amp;rsquo;s been a while. Today I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to present the next version of the Real Time For the Masses framework: cortex-m-rtfm v0.2.0 or just v2, which is how I like to call it.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the executive summary of the changes:
 v2 is simpler. v1 used a bunch of tokens &amp;ndash; ceiling tokens, priority tokens, preemption threshold tokens and task tokens &amp;ndash; for memory safety; this made the API rather boilerplatery.</description>

      <title>A CPU usage monitor for the RTFM framework</title>

      <description>We have used the RTFM framework in the previous posts but put most of the application logic in tasks, and always sent the processor to sleep in the idle function. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll put the idle function to better use and build a CPU usage monitor there.
Idle The main logic of the CPU usage monitor will be in the idle function. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how it works:

      <description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the different alternatives one has to log data from a microcontroller to some host machine. Be it for printf style debugging or for logging sensor data.
The Blue Pill This time I&amp;rsquo;ll use a different development board: the Blue Pill.
On the center the Blue Pill development board. On the left side a UART to USB adapter based on the CH340G. On the right side an SWD programmer: a Chinese clone of the ST-LINK.</description>

      <title>Overhead analysis of the RTFM framework</title>

      <description>In the last post I introduced the RTFM framework, and made several claims about it being highly efficient both in memory usage and runtime overhead. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll analyze all the RTFM concurrency primitives to back up those claims. To do that I&amp;rsquo;ll first introduce a non-invasive timing method that&amp;rsquo;s accurate to a single clock cycle, which is the time the processor spends to execute one of the simplest instructions.</description>

      <description>I want to start by thanking all the people that has sent improvements and comments to all the crates and tools I presented in the last blog post. The Rust community rocks!
Last time I showed you how to easily develop Rust programs for pretty much any ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show you one way of doing memory safe concurrency. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that the Rust language doesn&amp;rsquo;t impose a single concurrency model.</description>

      <description>NOTE Embedded Rust development makes use of the nightly channel. The nightly channel moves fast and breaks things unapologetically. That&amp;rsquo;s why if you want to follow these steps you must use the exact same versions (crates&amp;rsquo; and nightly&amp;rsquo;s) used in these steps. If you want to try the latest and greatest of embeded Rust and use the latest nightly then go grab the latest version of the cortex-m-quickstart template.</description>

      <description>Hey there! Welcome to my blog, where I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about Rust and embedded systems-y stuff &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s it, mainly about programming ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers as that&amp;rsquo;s what Rust best supports today 1. But, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in anything that has a #![no_std] attribute in it 2 so I may cover some other stuff as well.
That being said, this first post is neither about Rust or embedded stuff as it&amp;rsquo;s mainly for testing my blogging setup; so, why not write about that instead?</description>
